Simple launchd agent that periodically checks for current battery level
and sends a notification if it has reached or exceeded 80% to avoid any
possible degradation in battery health.

Usage:
======
The makefile uses gnu stow to symlink the job definition file to the appropriate
location for the current user(~/Library/LaunchAgents). To link and bootstrap
the service for the target domain simply run: make.

To edit the run interval for the script override the "INTERVAL" variable
and run: make update-interval. Currently it is set to 900(secs i.e. after
every 15minutes).

Note:
=====
You may specify the path where the script is intended to be located by
overriding the "SCRIPTDIR" variable in the makefile and it will create
a symlink to the specified location. You also need to update the job
definition file(the "Program" key) so that it points to the configured path.
